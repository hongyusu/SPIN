	Abstract = {Supervised Learning in Multi-Layered Neural Networks
                  (MLNs) has been recently proposed through the
                  well-known Backpropagation algorithm. This is a
                  gradient method which can get stuck in local minima,
                  as simple examples can show. In this paper, some
                  conditions on the network architecture and the
                  learning environment are proposed which ensure the
                  convergence of the Backpropagation algorithm. It is
                  proven in particular that the convergence holds if
                  the classes are linearly-separable. In this case,
                  the experience gained in several experiments shows
                  that $MLNs$ exceed perceptrons in generalization to
                  new examples.},
